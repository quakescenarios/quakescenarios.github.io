<h3>Computation of Peak Ground Velocity and Modified Mercalli Intensity</h3>
<p>
We draw on Akkar and Bommer (2010) to relate peak ground velocity (PGV) to earthquake magnitude, distance, with adjustments for soil conditions and the type-of-fault. According to Equation (3) of their paper: 
\begin{align}
\log_{10}(PGV) = b_0+b_1 M+b_2 M^2+\\ <br>(b_3+b_4 M)\log_{10} \sqrt{R_{jb}^2+b_5^2} \\ <br>
+b_6 S_S + b_7 S_A +b_8 F_N + b_9 F_R 
\end{align}
In this equation, \(M \) refers to the magnitude of the earthquake; \( R_{jb} \) to the (Joyce-Boyner) distance (in kilometers) between the earthquake epicenter and the location at which the peak ground velocity is being computed; \( S_S \) and \( S_A \) are, respectively, indicator variables equal to one if the location has soft or stiff soil conditions. Finally, \( F_N \) and \( F_R \) are, respectively, indicator variables characterizing whether the earthquake fault is normal or reverse. Note, this equation describes the central tendency of peak ground velocity felt in different locations; there is considerable dispersion (both within and across earthquakes) that one can characterize, which we abstract from for now. 
</p>
<p>
Akkar and Bommer estimate ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) from data collected from 532 accelerograms during 131 earthquakes (recorded between 1973 and 2003, with magnitude between 5.0 and 7.6). The GMPEs describe ground shaking at different sites over the first few sectors after earthquakes of given magnitudes. The peak ground velocity is one statistic that can be computed from these GMPEs. Akkar and Bommer's estimation yields the following values for \( b_0 \) to \( b_9 \):

<p> Applying the above equation requires values for \( S_S \), \( S_A \), \( F_R \) and \( F_N \). From the USGS, we retrieve the "<a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d815a9ae4b0c4f70d0586c8">Global VS30 Map</a>". This map contains the time-averaged shear-wave velocity \(V_{s,30} \)  in the upper 30 meters at different locations. Following Akkar and Bommer, among others, we set \( S_S =1 \) if \(V_{s,30}<360 m/s \) and \( S_A =1 \) if \( V_{s,30} \) is between \(<360 m/s \) and \(<750 m/s \).
 In Turkey, the two main faults &#8212; the Northen Anatolian and Eastern Anatolian faults &#8212; are both strike-slip faults. For these,

<p> Having computed an earthquake's peak groun velocity by location, we apply the formula estimated by Atkinson and Kaka (2006), relating felt intensity to peak ground velocity: 
\[ MMI = 4.40 + 1.92 \log_{10}(PGV)  + 0.280 (\log_{10}(PGV) )^2 \].
